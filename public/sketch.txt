and the whole div of ButtonElement by using DOM ..document.queryselector(inside className)
after that find the width of the whole buttons div

offsetLeft two eleements difference
You encountered an issue with the middle display of the categoryBar.

You used the useEffect hook to run code when the component mounts.
You stored the active button's information in the activeButton state variable.
You used document.querySelector to select the entire button container div and the individual button elements inside it.
You calculated the width of the entire button container div.
You measured the width of the active button using offsetWidth.
You used offsetLeft to find the horizontal difference between two elements, which can help with positioning.
